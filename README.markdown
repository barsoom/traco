# Traco

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/barsoom/traco.png)](http://travis-ci.org/barsoom/traco)

Translatable attributes for Rails 3, stored in the model table itself.

Inspired by Iain Hecker's [translatable_columns](https://github.com/iain/translatable_columns/).

To store translations outside the model, see Sven Fuchs' [globalize3](https://github.com/svenfuchs/globalize3).


## Usage

Say you want `Post#title` and `Post#body` to support both English and Swedish values.

Write a migration to get database columns with locale suffixes, e.g. `title_sv` and `title_en`, like:

```ruby
class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :posts do |t|
      t.string :title_sv, :title_en
      t.text :body_sv, :body_en

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

Don't create a database column named `title` without a suffix, since Traco will define a method with that name.

E.g. `title_pt-BR` is also fine, if you need to use that locale format.

Declare the attributes in the model:

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  translates :title, :body
end
```

You can still use your accessors like `title_sv` and `title_sv=` in forms, validations and other code, but you also get:

`#title`: Shows the title in the current locale. If blank, falls back to default locale. Otherwise nil.

`#title=`: Assigns the title to the column for the current locale, if present. Raises if the column doesn't exist.

`.human_attribute_name(:title_sv)`: Extends this standard method to return "Title (Swedish)" if you have a translation key `i18n.languages.sv = "Swedish"` and "Title (SV)" otherwise. Rails uses this method to build validation error messages and form labels.

`.translatable_attributes`: Returns an array like `[:title, :body]`.

`.locale_columns(:title)`: Returns an array like `[:title_sv, :title_en]` sorted with default locale first and then alphabetically. Suitable for looping in forms:

```erb
<% Post.locale_columns(:title).each do |column| %>
  <p>
    <%= form.label column %>
    <%= form.text_field column %>
  </p>
<% end %>
```

Or perhaps for things like:

```ruby
attr_accessible *locale_columns(:title)

validates *locale_columns(:title), :uniqueness => true
```

You can also pass multiple attributes if you like:

```ruby
attr_accessible *locale_columns(:title, :body)
```

The return value will be sorted like `[:title_sv, :title_en, :body_sv, :body_en]`.

`.locales_for_attribute(:title)`: Returns an array like `[:sv, :en]` sorted with default locale first and then alphabetically.

And the equivalent methods for `body`, of course.

Please note that your `translates :title, :body` declaration must be called before you call `locale_columns`. Otherwise you will get an error like "NoMethodError: undefined method `locale\_columns' for #\<Class:0x00000003f69188\>".


### Disable fallback

if you specify

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  translates :title, :body,
    fallback: false
end
```

then `#title` will return `nil` if there is no translation in the current locale, instead of falling back to the default locale.


### Overriding methods

Methods are defined in an included module, so you can just override them and call Traco's implementation with `super`:

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  translates :title

  def title
    super.reverse
  end
end
```

## Installation

Add this to your `Gemfile` if you use Bundler 1.1+:

```ruby
gem 'traco'
```

Then run

    bundle

to install it.


## Running the tests

    bundle
    rake # or guard


<!-- Keeping this a hidden brain dump for now.

## TODO

We've intentionally kept this simple with no features we do not need.
We'd be happy to merge additional features that others contribute.

Possible improvements to make:

  * Validation that checks that at least one translation for a column exists.
  * Validation that checks that every translation for a column exists.
  * Option to disable fallback.
  * Scopes like `translated`, `translated_to(locale)`.
  * Support for region locales, like `en-US` and `en-GB`.

# Changelog

## 5.3.2

* This version is only to actually include this CHANGELOG in the gem, so you can see the below if you compare gem diffs ðŸ˜…

## 5.3.1

* This version is only to clarify a backwards incompatibility if relying on undocumented behaviour:

  Readers like `post.title` no longer accept (and ignore) arbitrary keyword arguments.

  So if you would e.g. override a reader like this before:

      def my_title(my_arg:)
        super || "my fallback #{my_arg}"
      end

  You will instead need to do:

      def my_title(my_arg:)
        super() || "my fallback #{my_arg}"
      end

## 5.3.0

* Feature: You can pass a desired locale to readers and query methods, e.g. `post.title(locale: :de)` to get the German-locale title, and `post.title?(locale: :de)` to check if one exists. This ignores fallback settings â€“ use `I18n.with_locale(:de) { post.title }` if you want fallbacks.

## 5.2.0

* Feature: `locale_columns` without a passed column name returns all locale columns. Thanks to [manuelmeurer](https://github.com/manuelmeurer)!

## 5.1.0

* Feature: Add `fallback: :i18n` to use the fallbacks from `I18n.fallbacks`. Thanks to [sunny](https://github.com/sunny)!

## 5.0.0

* Change `locale_columns` and `locales_for_attribute` to sort current locale first, then default locale (previously, it was default locale first). This makes more sense for our own apps, and hopefully other apps as well.

## 4.0.0

* Drop support for end-of-lifed Ruby 2.1 and 2.2.

## 3.3.0

* Traco now automatically adds query methods, e.g. `Item#title?` when `title` is translated.

## 3.2.2

* Internal cleanup.

## 3.2.1

* Bugfix: with `fallback: [:sv]`, always look at current locale before any fallbacks.

## 3.2.0

* Introduce e.g. `fallback: [:sv]` to explicitly specify fallbacks.

## 3.1.6

Make [license (MIT)](LICENSE.txt) easier to autodetect.

## 3.1.5

* Bugfix: don't raise error loading models before the DB is created. Thanks to PikachuEXE and Andrii Malyshko.

## 3.1.4

* Bugfix: restore sorting of `locale_columns` and `locales_for_attribute` to put default locale first, not current locale. Thanks to PikachuEXE.

## 3.1.3

 * ~20 time speedup thanks to optimizations by Andrii Malyshko.

   Reading a Traco translated attribute used to be ~250x slower than an untranslated attribute; now it's down to ~10x slower.

## 3.1.2

* Bugfix: `.current_locale_column` handles dashed locales like "pt-BR" correctly. Thanks to PikachuEXE.

## 3.1.1

* Bugfix around fallbacks and memoization. Thanks to PikachuEXE.

## 3.1.0

* Introduce `.current_locale_column`, e.g. `Post.current_locale_column(:title)  # => :title_sv`.

## 3.0.0

* Backwards incompatible: `fallback: true` is now `fallback: :default`. Since this was the implicit default value, you shouldn't have a problem unless you explicitly declared this value.

## 2.2.0

* `fallback: :any` to fall back to any other locale if the text is blank in the current and default locales.

## 2.1.0

* Attribute readers can override the attribute's `fallback` setting, e.g. `item.title(fallback: false)`.

## 2.0.0

* Backwards incompatible: for dashed locales like "pt-BR", the column names are now expected to end in e.g. `_pt_br`, not `_pt-BR`.

## 1.3.0

Whatever we had before introducing this changelog.
